# ReuseMe

ReuseMe provides a [Command Line Interface](#local-development-command-line-interface) and [integration with GitHub Actions](#cicd-validation-github-actions) for managing software licensing and copyright attributions, including support for:

* [Validation](./docs/specifications.md) of your files against the [Reuse specification]
<img src="./docs/images/cli_example.svg">
* Generation of an SPDX 2.3 compatible Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)

Hub is a lot of things, but it’s not a law firm. As such, GitHub does not provide legal advice. Using the API or sending us an email about it does not constitute legal advice nor does it create an attorney-client relationship. If you have any questions about what you can and can't do with a particular license, you should consult with your own legal counsel before moving forward. In fact, you should always consult with your own lawyer before making any decisions that might have legal ramifications or that may impact your legal rights.

GitHub created these endpoints to help users get information about open source licenses and the projects that use them. We hope it helps, but please keep in mind that we’re not lawyers (at least most of us aren't) and that we make mistakes like everyone else. For that reason, GitHub provides the API on an "as-is" basis and makes no warranties regarding any information or licenses provided on or through it, and disclaims liability for damages resulting from using the API.

> ReuseMe is created for the aggregation of Copyright and License information provided by the users in the files stored in their repositories.

## CICD validation (GitHub Actions)

The basic workflow can be set up as such:

```yaml
name: Copyright & Licenses
on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  reuse-me:
    name: REUSE compliance
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: dev-build-deploy/reuse-me@v0
```

_You can find more details in the [dedicated documentation](./docs/github-action.md)_

## Local Development (Command Line Interface)

Performing local validation is as simple as running the `check` command...

```sh
$ reuse-me check
```

_You can find more details in the [dedicated documentation](./docs/cli.md)_
