# ReuseMe - License and Copyright Management

ReuseMe provides a [Pre-commit hook](#pre-commit), [Command Line Interface](#local-development-command-line-interface) and [integration with GitHub Actions](#cicd-validation-github-actions) for managing software licensing and copyright attributions, including support for:

* [Validation](./docs/specifications.md) of your files against the [Reuse specification]
<img src="./docs/images/cli_example.svg">
* Generation of an SPDX 2.3 compatible Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)

## Pre-commit hook

You can add ReuseMe as a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) by:

1. [Installing pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#install)
2. Including ReuseMe in your `.pre-commit.config.yaml` file, e.g.:

```yaml
repos:
- repo: https://github.com/dev-build-deploy/reuse-me
  rev: v0.8.0
  hooks:
  - id: reuse-me
```
3. Installing the hooks
```
$ pre-commit install
```

## CICD validation (GitHub Actions)

The basic workflow can be set up as such:

```yaml
name: Copyright & Licenses
on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  reuse-me:
    name: REUSE compliance
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: dev-build-deploy/reuse-me@v0
```

_You can find more details in the [dedicated documentation](./docs/github-action.md)_

## Local Development (Command Line Interface)

Performing local validation is as simple as running the `reuse-me` CLI tool;

```sh
$ reuse-me
```

_You can find more details in the [dedicated documentation](./docs/cli.md)_
